I mostly use it to make whipped coffee but I've also used it for mixing protein powder in milk and frothing milk / creamer for coffee.It is incredible effective for exclusively liquid substances like milk and creamer; I realized this after over-frothing my creamer one morning to the point of pure foam lol. After that I kept it in mind and I know to only do it for a short amount of time. Super easy to use, versatile in what it can be used for (as far as liquids go), and tbh it just looks really cute on the coffee-making section of my counter. The stand is a hugeeee plus, I definitely wouldn't purchase an alternative option without one.It gets the job done for whipped coffee.I also use this product to blend my matcha powder and my turmeric-cinnamon-ginger-coconut milk powder lattes. This frother takes out all the lumps and bumps. Because the resulting blend is smooth, it does not waste the ingredients like stirring with a spoon. So, so great! It has made my favorites even more practical and delicious. I have not found anything about this product that I do not like. I would recommend this product to others and have already done so. Get it! You will be pleased. It is the best Coffee Beater.,I really liked this coffee frother. With its help I am making Cappuccino Latte at home easily. Easy to clean also.,This oratech coffee frother makes coffee game easier and fun.After using it for a week. I‚Äôm sharing its pros and consPros:1. Frothing milk for coffee is easier and fun with Oratech Coffee Beater.2. Material quality is good.3. It is portable so you can use it anywhere.4. It is small so you can keep it anywhere.Cons:1.

         "Overall, I love this Oratech Coffee frother and have used it soooo many times since purchasing it. I mostly use it to make whipped coffee but I've also used it for mixing protein powder in milk and frothing milk / creamer for coffee.It is incredible effective for exclusively liquid substances like milk and creamer; I realized this after over-frothing my creamer one morning to the point of pure foam lol. After that I kept it in mind and I know to only do it for a short amount of time. Super easy to use, versatile in what it can be used for (as far as liquids go), and tbh it just looks really cute on the coffee-making section of my counter. The stand is a hugeeee plus, I definitely wouldn't purchase an alternative option without one.It gets the job done for whipped coffee.I also use this product to blend my matcha powder and my turmeric-cinnamon-ginger-coconut milk powder lattes. This frother takes out all the lumps and bumps. Because the resulting blend is smooth, it does not waste the ingredients like stirring with a spoon. So, so great! It has made my favorites even more practical and delicious. I have not found anything about this product that I do not like. I would recommend this product to others and have already done so. Get it! You will be pleased. It is the best Coffee Beater.,I really liked this coffee frother. With its help I am making Cappuccino Latte at home easily. Easy to clean also.,This oratech coffee frother makes coffee game easier and fun.After using it for a week. I‚Äôm sharing its pros and consPros:1. Frothing milk for coffee is easier and fun with Oratech Coffee Beater.2. Material quality is good.3. It is portable so you can use it anywhere.4. It is small so you can keep it anywhere.Cons:1. Frothing heavy liquid is tough.My overall feeling about this product is it you are coffee lover and you want to make foamy coffee. It is best for you.,Best quality product. Easy to use and easy to clean. Best coffee frother and easy to coffee making. I loved this product.,This product is easy to use, durable and helps in blending quickly.,Such a good product and enjoying to make coffee and handy too.üëçüòäüòä,Best milk frother for coffeeIt is easy to use.,Every coffee lover must try this electric coffee frother",
